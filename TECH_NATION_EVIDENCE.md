Evidence 1 – Mandatory Criterion (Innovation)

NxtAbroad AI – Visa Readiness & Eligibility Intelligence Engine

Applicant: Ibrahim Akintunde Akinyera

1. Summary of Evidence

This document explains how NxtAbroad AI, an automated visa readiness and eligibility scoring engine, demonstrates founder-led innovation and technical leadership by Ibrahim Akintunde Akinyera.

NxtAbroad AI is a fully engineered digital system used operationally inside NxtAbroad Limited (UK–Nigeria) to assess the academic, financial, documentation and risk readiness of international student visa applicants across the UK, Canada, Europe and the UAE.

This evidence supports the Mandatory Criterion by showing:
	•	Creation of an innovative product
	•	Direct technical leadership and implementation
	•	Real-world deployment and customer impact
	•	A scalable rules-driven solution uncommon in the Nigerian EdTech + immigration market


2. Description of the Product

NxtAbroad AI is a rules-driven intelligence engine that evaluates:
	•	Academic eligibility
	•	Financial capacity and proof-of-funds
	•	Documentation quality
	•	Immigration risk indicators
	•	Multi-country visa requirements
	•	Overall visa readiness score (Low / Medium / High)

The system is actively used by NxtAbroad staff to determine student readiness and prevent errors that lead to visa refusals.

It processes hundreds of profiles per intake and is a foundational component of the organisation’s digital operations.

3. Applicant’s Role (Founder & Lead Engineer)

Ibrahim independently:
	•	Identified the operational challenge
	•	Designed the full product architecture
	•	Engineered the rule-based logic and scoring system
	•	Built and deployed the Python-based modules
	•	Created the technical diagrams and decision flows
	•	Integrated the system into the company’s operational workflow

His contribution demonstrates end-to-end ownership as both Founder and Lead Engineer.

4. Technical Architecture Overview

The architecture consists of the following layers:

Input Layer
	•	Student profile data
	•	Academic documents
	•	Financial documents
	•	Selected country/destination

Processing Layer
	•	Academic eligibility rules
	•	Financial readiness evaluation
	•	Document completeness checks
	•	Immigration risk indicators

Core Engine
	•	Python rules engine
	•	Weighted scoring model
	•	Decision-logic evaluator
	•	Output formatter

Output Layer
	•	Eligibility result
	•	Visa readiness score
	•	Risk classification
	•	Advisor-ready report

	•	docs/figures/architecture.png
	•	docs/figures/scoring_flow.png

5. Problem Solved & Innovation

Before NxtAbroad AI:
	•	Advisor decisions were inconsistent
	•	Assessment times were long (25–40 minutes)
	•	Manual evaluation introduced avoidable errors
	•	Multi-country rules were difficult to track
	•	Scaling operations across the UK and Nigeria was not feasible

Innovation introduced by Ibrahim:
	•	Conversion of immigration policies into programmable rules
	•	Automated scoring for accuracy and consistency
	•	Multi-country evaluation within one system
	•	Standardised decision-making across all advisors
	•	Reduced assessment time to under 5 minutes
	•	Introduction of a digital, tech-driven workflow rarely used in similar agencies

This product is both innovative and founder-led, clearly meeting the Mandatory Criterion.

6. Impact & Measurable Outcomes

NxtAbroad AI has delivered significant real-world impact:
	•	Increased Efficiency – Evaluation time reduced from 25–40 minutes to < 5 minutes
	•	Higher Accuracy – Fewer missing-document cases and reduced visa risks
	•	Scalability – Consistent assessments across UK and Nigeria offices
	•	Improved Quality Control – Standardised logic replaces subjective staff judgment
	•	Operational Growth – System supports increased application volume

The tool is actively used within the business, making this evidence verifiable and practical.
