# TECH NATION EVIDENCE – NxtAbroad AI (Visa Readiness & Eligibility Engine)

## Evidence Type  
Mandatory Criterion – Recognition as a Leading Founder of a Digital Product

## Applicant  
Ibrahim Akintunde Akinyera  
Founder, NxtAbroad Limited

------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. Overview

NxtAbroad AI is an intelligent visa readiness and eligibility scoring engine designed to standardise student evaluation for international study routes (UK, Canada, Europe, UAE). It provides structured, explainable assessments by analysing academic history, financial readiness, documentation quality, credibility indicators, and immigration risk signals.

The system was fully architected and implemented by **Ibrahim Akintunde Akinyera** as part of his work as Founder of **NxtAbroad Limited**. It has been used on hundreds of real student applications and has significantly improved processing consistency, speed, and decision quality across NxtAbroad’s Nigerian and UK operations.

This project is submitted as a key piece of evidence for the Mandatory Criterion demonstrating innovation, product leadership, and technical contribution.

------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. Problem Statement

Prior to NxtAbroad AI, the student evaluation process within NxtAbroad (and across most education agencies) suffered from the following:

- Decisions varied significantly between advisors.  
- No unified rulebook or objective scoring method.  
- High dependency on individual staff judgement.  
- Missing or incomplete documentation frequently caused preventable visa refusals.  
- Training new staff required lengthy manual coaching.  
- There was no audit trail explaining why decisions were made.  

These issues created operational inconsistencies and increased the risk of visa refusal for students.

NxtAbroad AI was created to eliminate subjectivity by introducing a **rule-driven, consistent, transparent digital evaluation engine**.

## 3. Technical Contribution & Responsibilities

Ibrahim designed, built, documented, and deployed the entire engine:

### 3.1 System Architecture
- Designed the multi-layer system including:
  - Rule Engine (academic, financial, documentation, credibility)
  - Scoring Engine (0–100 readiness score)
  - Band Classification (Low, Medium, High)
  - Utilities for parsing and validating profile data
  - Support for UK, Canada, EU, UAE variations

- Created the architecture and scoring flow diagrams in `docs/figures`.

### 3.2 Implementation
All core implementation was completed by Ibrahim, including:

- `src/rules_engine.py` – business rules for each evaluation domain  
- `src/scoring.py` – readiness scoring logic and score aggregation  
- `src/utils.py` – helper modules for validation and structured input  
- `data/sample_profiles/` – test profiles for demonstration  
- Integration of POF thresholds, GPA thresholds, gap-year logic, sponsor validation, and credibility flags  
- Internal improvements based on feedback from NxtAbroad’s advisory team  

### 3.3 Documentation & Evidence
Ibrahim also prepared:

- The full README documentation  
- TECH_NATION_EVIDENCE.md summary  
- Evidence_1 PDF (included in repo)  
- Architecture diagrams  
- Category scoring guidelines  
- End-to-end examples  

------------------------------------------------------------
## 4. Business Impact

The engine has generated significant operational improvements at NxtAbroad:

### 4.1 Increased Consistency  
Evaluations across multiple advisors and offices now follow a unified scoring model, reducing inconsistent decisions.

### 4.2 Fewer Avoidable Errors  
Documentation gaps, mismatches, and financial issues are flagged before any application is submitted, reducing preventable refusals.

### 4.3 Faster Processing  
Applications that previously took 20–30 minutes to manually evaluate can now be screened in seconds.

### 4.4 Scalable Training  
New staff can be onboarded far more quickly because decisions are now rule-based rather than intuition-based.

### 4.5 Foundation for a Future Fully Automated Admissions Engine  
NxtAbroad AI has become the backbone for additional automation efforts including:
- automated document checks  
- statement of purpose analysis  
- credibility assessment modules  
- UK/Canada admissions auto-pipeline
