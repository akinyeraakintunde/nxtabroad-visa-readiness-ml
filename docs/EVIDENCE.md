# Tech Nation Evidence Page – NxtAbroad AI (Visa Readiness ML)

## Project Title
NxtAbroad AI – Visa Readiness & Risk Intelligence (Open-Source ML Product)

## Applicant
Ibrahim Akintunde Akinyera (Belfast, Northern Ireland)

## Purpose (What problem this solves)
NxtAbroad AI is a machine-learning driven digital product designed to support visa readiness decision-making.
It aims to help applicants and operators understand potential risk factors and readiness indicators using a structured ML workflow.

## What this demonstrates (Why this matters for Tech Nation)
This repository demonstrates:
- Product-led engineering and system thinking
- Applied machine learning for classification and risk analysis
- Documentation and open-source contribution
- Practical problem solving for a real-world operational domain

## Architecture (High level)
- Frontend (planned): User interface and results presentation
- Backend API (FastAPI): Serves endpoints for health checks and ML scoring
- ML pipeline: Data preparation, training, evaluation, and inference readiness
- Documentation: Clear separation of backend + frontend documentation

## Your Role
Founder / Product Lead / ML Engineer
- Defined the product goal and roadmap
- Designed the backend architecture and API structure
- Built and documented the ML approach and scoring intent
- Prepared the repository in reviewer-friendly format

## Key Technical Components
- Backend API: FastAPI + Uvicorn
- Data models: Pydantic validation
- ML layer: Training + evaluation + inference structure (project-specific)
- Documentation: README files + evidence packaging
