# NxtAbroad AI – Visa Readiness & Eligibility Intelligence Engine

NxtAbroad AI is an intelligent rules-driven scoring engine designed to evaluate student eligibility, visa readiness, and documentation strength for international study routes including the United Kingdom, Canada, Europe, and the UAE.

The system was fully designed and engineered by **Ibrahim Akintunde Akinyera**, Founder of **NxtAbroad Limited**, and is actively used inside the organisation’s processing workflow.

This repository serves as part of Ibrahim’s **UK Global Talent Visa (Digital Technology)** submission under the **Mandatory Criterion – Proof of Founding an Innovative Product**.

## 1. Overview

NxtAbroad AI introduces a structured, automated assessment process that replaces subjective judgement with consistent decision logic.

The engine evaluates:

- Academic eligibility  
- Financial readiness  
- Documentation quality  
- Immigration credibility signals  
- Visa success likelihood  

It has processed **hundreds of student profiles** and significantly improved the company’s efficiency and accuracy.

## 2. Key Capabilities

- Multi-country criteria evaluation (UK, Canada, EU, UAE)  
- Visa readiness scoring (Low / Medium / High)  
- Modular rule engine for academic, financial and risk scoring  
- Automated document completeness checks  
- Python-based architecture suitable for scaling  
- Deployed internally for daily operations
