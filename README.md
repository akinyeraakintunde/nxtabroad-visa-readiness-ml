# NxtAbroad AI – Visa Readiness & Risk Intelligence (ML)

NxtAbroad AI is an open-source, machine-learning powered digital product designed to support visa readiness assessment and operational risk insight.

This project demonstrates applied artificial intelligence, product-led engineering, and backend API development for real-world decision support systems.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Visa and immigration processes often rely on fragmented assessments and manual judgment.
NxtAbroad AI explores how machine learning can support:
- Readiness classification
- Risk signal identification
- Data-driven decision support

The system is designed to be transparent, explainable, and extensible.

---

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates
- Applied machine learning for classification problems
- Backend API development using FastAPI
- Clean project structuring and documentation
- Product thinking beyond experimental notebooks
- Open-source contribution and reproducibility
